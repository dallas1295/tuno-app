# Tuno Web App

## **Here is the home for Tuno's front-end web application**

with the api's version 1 release it's time to start builidng the web application that users (mostly me) will be able to use to interact with the API.

## A Change in Format

- as the API is written in Deno, for more experience with a more "vanilla" or standard project setup, the front-end will be written with NodeJS. This is mostly for more experience and the ability to know with confidence how to use both.
- this will provide some more experience with a default React experience as well as be able to provide me with the knowledge to use the default TypeScript compiler and other services.
